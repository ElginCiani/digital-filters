A modified second and third order Butterworth low pass filter that incorporates resonance near the cutoff frequency with gain adjustment.

Running the program with no input will generate white noise.
LowPassRes [input.wav] to run the program with given audio loop.

Note: I recommend starting at low volume and increasing after running program.
