A 12 dB/octave 10-band graphic equalizer (with constant Q-factors) for the frequency range 20Hz-20kHz.
Adjust the sliders to change the volume of each frequency range between +/- 18 dB.

Running the program with no input will generate white noise.
Equalizer [input.wav] to run the program with given audio loop.

Note: I recommend starting at low volume and increasing after running program.
