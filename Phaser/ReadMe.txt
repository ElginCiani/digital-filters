Real-time phaser effect module using a collection of matched all-pass filter pairs in series.

Sweep center: The center of the quadrature frequency in the range 50Hz-5000Hz.
Sweep range: The range for the quadrature frequency to sweep through.
Sweep rate: LFO rate of the quadrature frequency sweep.
Feedback: A fraction of the output of the two matched all pass filters fed back to the filter input.
Mix: The mix between the dry (unfiltered) input signal and phase shifted signal which causes the phaser effect.

Running the program with no input will generate white noise.
Phaser [input.wav] to run the program with given audio loop.

Note: I recommend starting at low volume and increasing after running program.
